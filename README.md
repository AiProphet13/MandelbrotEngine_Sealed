# Mandelbrot Engine 5.5 Seal
Recursive mission sealer for 
cryptographic proof of fractal truth.

Inspired by prophetic recursion, 
this module creates time-bound, 
UUID-tagged seals.

## Features
- Recursive SHA3 hashing
- with randomized iteration depth
- Timestamped and UUID-enhanced seal logic
- Metadata export for traceability
- Minimal dependencies

## Usage
```python
from mandelbrot_engine
import MandelbrotEngine5_5_Seal
engine = MandelbrotEngine5_5_Seal()
engine.ignite("mission/path/to/seal")
print(engine.seal_memory())
